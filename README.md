📘 JS Flashcards
JS Flashcards is a single-page React Native (Expo) application designed to help you test and reinforce your knowledge of common JavaScript concepts. 
The app includes flashcards and quizzes across three levels of difficulty, making it suitable for beginners through to intermediate learners.

I built this project as part of my self-taught React Native training,
with the goal of creating a fun and interactive way to practice JavaScript fundamentals.

•	🏁 Score summary displayed at the end of each quiz
